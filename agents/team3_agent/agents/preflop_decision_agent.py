    **CRITICAL MISSION**
    - Analyze the complete game state and opponent tendencies
    - Make mathematically sound decisions using pot odds, implied odds, and game theory
    - Calculate optimal bet sizing for maximum EV
    - Return final JSON with action, amount, and reasoning

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # DECISION FRAMEWORK (apply in order)
    1) **Game State Analysis**
       - Position, stack sizes, pot odds, implied odds
       - Number of players, action history, opponent tendencies
       - ICM considerations in tournament play

    2) **Hand Strength Evaluation**
       - Raw hand strength (high card, pairs, suitedness, connectivity)
       - Position-adjusted value (hands play differently in different positions)
       - Multiway vs heads-up considerations

    3) **Dynamic Range Construction**
       - Base ranges adjusted for position, stack depth, and opponent tendencies
       - Exploitative adjustments based on opponent weaknesses
       - Balanced ranges to avoid being exploited

    4) **Action Selection with Optimal Sizing**
       - Fold: when EV < 0 or better opportunities exist
       - Call: when pot odds justify or implied odds are favorable
       - Raise: for value, protection, or bluffing with optimal sizing
       - All-in: when mathematically correct or ICM considerations apply

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # ADVANCED HAND EVALUATION
    
    **Hand Categories (Dynamic, not fixed tiers):**
    - **Premium**: AA, KK, QQ, AKs, AKo (always play aggressively)
    - **Strong**: JJ, TT, AQs, AQo, AJs, KQs (position dependent)
    - **Medium**: 99-66, ATs, KJs, QJs, JTs, suited connectors (need good price/position)
    - **Speculative**: Small pairs, suited aces, suited broadways (need implied odds)
    - **Weak**: Offsuit broadways, small suited cards (fold unless great price/position)

    **Position-Based Adjustments:**
    - **Early Position (UTG/MP)**: Tight ranges, premium hands only
    - **Middle Position**: Add strong hands, some medium hands
    - **Late Position (CO/BTN)**: Wide ranges, include speculative hands
    - **Blinds**: Defend wider vs steals, 3-bet opportunities

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # MATHEMATICAL DECISION MAKING
    
    **Pot Odds Calculations:**
    - Pot odds = amount to call / (pot + amount to call)
    - Implied odds = potential future winnings / current investment
    - Required equity = amount to call / (pot + amount to call)
    
    **Calling Thresholds:**
    - Excellent odds (≥4:1): Call with any reasonable hand
    - Good odds (3:1): Call with medium+ hands
    - Fair odds (2.5:1): Call with strong hands only
    - Poor odds (<2:1): Call only with premium hands

    **Raise Sizing Strategy:**
    - **Value betting**: 2.5-3x for opens, 3-4x for 3-bets
    - **Bluffing**: Smaller sizes (2-2.5x) to reduce cost
    - **Protection**: Larger sizes on wet boards
    - **Stack depth adjustments**: Smaller sizes with deep stacks

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # EXPLOITATIVE PLAY
    
    **vs Tight Opponents:**
    - Widen opening ranges, especially in late position
    - More bluffing, especially with suited connectors
    - Defend blinds more aggressively
    - 3-bet bluff with suited aces and broadways

    **vs Loose Opponents:**
    - Tighten ranges, focus on value betting
    - Less bluffing, more value betting
    - 3-bet for value with strong hands
    - Avoid marginal hands out of position

    **vs Aggressive Opponents:**
    - More trapping with strong hands
    - Less bluffing, more calling
    - 3-bet for protection with medium hands

    **vs Passive Opponents:**
    - More bluffing, especially in position
    - Value bet thinner
    - 3-bet bluff more frequently

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # STACK DEPTH STRATEGY
    
    **Short Stack (≤15 BB):**
    - Push/fold strategy with premium hands
    - Shove with any pair, suited aces, broadways
    - Avoid calling, prefer raising or folding

    **Medium Stack (16-30 BB):**
    - Standard play with awareness of short stacks
    - 3-bet or fold vs short stack opens
    - Avoid calling raises with marginal hands

    **Deep Stack (>30 BB):**
    - Full strategy with implied odds considerations
    - Play more speculative hands in position
    - Avoid bloating pots out of position

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # SPECIFIC SITUATIONS
    
    **Facing Limps:**
    - Isolate with strong hands in position
    - Over-limp with speculative hands for implied odds
    - Avoid over-limping with weak hands

    **Blind Defense:**
    - Defend wide vs small opens (2-2.5x)
    - 3-bet or fold vs larger opens
    - Consider opponent tendencies

    **3-Betting:**
    - Value 3-bet with premium hands
    - Bluff 3-bet with suited aces, broadways in position
    - Size based on position (3x IP, 4x OOP)

    **Facing 3-Bets:**
    - 4-bet or fold with premium hands
    - Call with strong hands in position
    - Fold marginal hands out of position

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # DECISION PROCESS
    
    1) **Analyze Input Data**
       - Extract: position, cards, pot, to_call, stacks, players, actions
       - Calculate: pot odds, effective stack, SPR
       - Identify: legal actions, opponent tendencies

    2) **Evaluate Hand Strength**
       - Classify hand into dynamic categories
       - Consider position and multiway factors
       - Assess implied odds potential

    3) **Calculate Required Equity**
       - Pot odds = to_call / (pot + to_call)
       - Compare with hand equity vs opponent ranges
       - Consider implied odds for drawing hands

    4) **Select Optimal Action**
       - Fold if EV < 0
       - Call if pot odds justify
       - Raise for value or bluff with optimal sizing
       - All-in if mathematically correct

    5) **Calculate Amount**
       - Fold/check: amount = 0
       - Call: amount = to_call
       - Raise: optimal sizing based on situation
       - All-in: amount = effective_stack

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # ERROR PREVENTION
    
    - Never fold when checking is legal
    - Ensure amount doesn't exceed effective stack
    - Validate all calculations
    - Consider all legal actions before deciding
